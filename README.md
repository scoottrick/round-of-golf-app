# Round of Golf

Round of Golf is an app with a simple interface for keeping track of golf scores and storing them locally. It was created so I could practice React and other web programming skills. Well, that and because I'm tired of keeping track of a pencil and scorecard while I'm out on the golf course. :satisfied: :satisfied: :satisfied:
